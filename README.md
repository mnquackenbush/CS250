How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

By directly interacting with primary users of an end product, you can drill down on what the main functionalities and features a user wants out of your product. 
This is where "user stories" develop from; they act as a framework of those user's wants and needs and help to steer your development of product implementation in a
well-framed and testable format. As you gain more information from your users, you can further implement features and improve on the quality of your product to better
suit your end users.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing any program, you should always keep in the front of your mind what the actual purpose of your development is. Who are you developing this for?
Will anyone actually want to use it, and will they enjoy using it? Is this what people actually want out of a program, or just what *you* think they want?
In general, the user-motivated drive of Agile development is something I plan to incorporate in future work, to avoid making products that nobody actually wants to use.
Of course, if I am developing a product primarily for my own benefit, I can implement features however I choose because I know I will derive benefit from them, but when
developing a product for others (which is likely the case most of the time for developers), you must get out of your own head and into the customer's. The short-term 
sprints to push new implementation and then assess previous iteration's impact and approval rating is also a beneficial Agile technique to make sure development stays
moving in the right direction.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member is hard to define in a blanket statement, due to the fact that every team will be different from one another. This is one of the benefits of
an Agile environment: the framework is designed to be flexible according to the needs of the team. On an individual level, however, I feel that the main way that any
team member can be a "good" team member is by putting the needs of both the team and the end user before the opinions and feelings of yourself. This is not to say that 
your own perspective is not valid; on the contrary, it is vital to the success of the team. It is important to note though, that it is not *everything*, and that the 
opinions and ideas of other members of the team are also important and valuable, and often help to bolster and improve upon your own ideas in ways that you would not 
be able to have come up with all on your own.
